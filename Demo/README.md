# Urban Damage and Infrastructure Analysis Pipeline
## Demo for Kahramanmaraş City

The user is invited to try out different configurations, options etc. for the workflow.
This Demo provided here is just a representation of the capabilities of the code
for the Kahramanmaraş - Türkiye 2023 Earthquakes. Still, it is highly recommended to read through
the main README.md file instructions in main GitHub repository.

# Important
 As stated in the main instructions, user should put the two necessary Data
	1. DPM
	2. Population
		into the ./Data folder. 
 How_to_Downloads - instructions can be followed if necessary.
	
## The code is modular;
 once completely run, all of the pipeline can get the necessary data from
./Outputs/A-I folders to run itself. Hence if for instance;
Building Data Download Server is not working -> User is invited to download said data manually and paste it into ./Outputs/A folder. This will allow the code to read it from there and work without a problem.
